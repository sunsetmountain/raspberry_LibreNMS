Update packages and install git:

apt-get install git
```

Clone this repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/sunsetmountain/raspberry_LibreNMS
```

Change into the directory and run the installation script:

cd raspberry_LibreNMS
chmod +x initialsoftware.sh
./initialsoftware.sh
```

Configure a basic SNMP config file â€“ we will move the template and create a new file:
```
sudo nano /etc/snmp/snmpd.conf
```
Add your new SNMP parameters to the config file (replace with the appropriate info):
```
rocommunity infosoda
syslocation My Laboratory
syscontact Call the HelpDesk
```
Restart SNMP:
```
sudo service snmpd restart
```

Edit the SNMP configuration:
```
sudo nano config.php
```
Change the values to the right of the equal sign for lines beginning with $config[db_] to match your database information as setup above.

Change the value of $config['snmp']['community'][] from public to whatever your read-only SNMP community is. (e.g. $config['snmp']['community'][] = "myhome";)
-- note that the format in the original file could be $config['snmp']['community'] = array["public"] and should be changed


Initialize the database:
```
cd /opt/librenms/
sudo php build-base.php
```
Add user in the following format:
```
sudo php adduser.php <name> <pass> 10 <email>
```
Validate the install, and correct any errors:
```
sudo php validate.php 
```

Add the localhost:
```
sudo php addhost.php localhost public v2c
```

Discover the newly added localhost:
```
php discovery.php -h all
```

Create a cronjob:
```
cp librenms.nonroot.cron /etc/cron.d/librenms
```

At this point, your setup is complete and you should be able to log into the web interface utilizing the credentials created with the adduser.php command. Open your browser and browse to http://yourip
